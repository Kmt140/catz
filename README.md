II. Body

A. Myth #5: Cats always land on their feet.
1.	Cats’ Righting Reflex: While cats are known for their remarkable ability to land on their feet when falling, they are fallible. This “righting reflex” allows them to twist their bodies midair to land safely. However, it doesn’t guarantee they will always land on their feet.

2.	Limitations Based on Fall Height and Age: If the fall is too short, or the cat is too young or too old, they may not have enough time or agility to properly adjust their body and land safely. Cats rely on a certain distance for their righting reflex to activate effectively.


3.	Potential Dangers to Owners: This myth can lead to dangerous situations, as owners might not realize the risks of high places. Believing that cats will always land safely could result in neglecting to secure windows or balconies, putting their pets at risk of injury.
